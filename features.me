# Task Manager App Features

## ✅ Current Features (Done)
- Add, edit, delete, get tasks (UI + backend + database)
- Task saved per user (planned)
- Modular folder structure
- Frontend & backend separated

## 🔜 Upcoming Features (Planned)
- User registration with email
- Email verification system
- Google Sign-in
- JWT/session-based login (to be decided)
- Dashboard for user-specific tasks
- Error handling UI messages
- Form validations

Concurrent Plan: 
🔐 Authentication Flow 
1. User visits register.html 
2. Fills form -> Calls POST /api/auth/register
3. Backend creates user with isVerified: false -> Sends code via email 
4. User redirected to verify.html
5. User enters code -> Calls POST /api/auth/verify 
6. Backend checks code, marks isVerified: true -> Sends token (JWT)
7. Now user can go to dashboard.html and see tasks 

🔃 Login Flow 
1. User visits login.html 
2. Enter email+password -> Calls POST /api/auth/login 
3. If correct and verified -> Send token -> Access to dashboard 

🧠 Task Flow 
* User goes to dashboard.html -> Get /api/tasks with token 
* Backend checks token -> Fetches only this users tasks 
* Add/Edit/Delete users POST/PUT/DELETE /api/tasks/:id with auth check 

🦾In Progress: 
- Logign & Signup System 
- JWT Token-Based Auth 
- UI for Register/Login 


## 💡 Future Ideas
- Task categories/labels (work, personal, etc.)
- Due dates/reminders
- Priority levels
- Drag & drop task ordering
- Dark mode
- Mobile view optimization
